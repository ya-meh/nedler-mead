# Basic implementation of Nelder–Mead method

Simpler implementation of Nelder–Mead algorithm.

The Nelder–Mead method (also downhill simplex method, amoeba method, or polytope method) is a numerical method used to find 
the minimum or maximum of an objective function in a multidimensional space. It is a direct search method (based on function 
comparison) and is often applied to nonlinear optimization problems for which derivatives may not be known.
